    /// 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
    /// Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
    /// If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), 
    /// design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
    /// 
    /// Example 1:
    /// Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
    /// Output: 5
    /// max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
    /// 
    /// Example 2:
    /// Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
    /// Output: 0
    /// In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
